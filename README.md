- 👋 Hi, I’m Devin Suttler aka @dsuttler | Senior Computer Science Student @ Old Dominion University
- 👀 My goal is to become a Software Engineer at a major tech company. Cliche I know... 
      What is not cliche about me is the fact that I am not a progidy coder. I have not
      been making apps since I was 8, nor does programming come naturally to me. I work 
      hard in my own time to learn the skills I need to become successful in this 
      career. One of my favorite quotes is from Thomas Edison states "I have not
      failed. I have just found 10,000 ways that wont work." I will keep attacking a
      problem, a theory, a language, and any obstacle until I can overcome and/or 
      find a solution. This career has been a goal of mine since I saw my first iPhone
      and learned the story of Apple. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java as well as "Data Structures & Algorithms"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to get my feet wet into the workd of Software Engineering.
